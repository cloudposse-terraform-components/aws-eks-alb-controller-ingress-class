# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component deploys a Kubernetes `IngressClass` resource for the AWS Load Balancer Controller. This is not often
  needed, as the default IngressClass deployed by the `eks/alb-controller` component is sufficient for most use cases, and
  when it is not, a service can deploy its own IngressClass. This is for the rare case where you want to deploy an
  additional IngressClass deploying an additional ALB that you nevertheless want to be shared by some services, with none
  of them explicitly owning it.
